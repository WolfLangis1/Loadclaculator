# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the development of a comprehensive Inspection and Code Compliance Management system that transforms the existing load calculator from a design tool into a complete project lifecycle management platform. This feature will provide electrical professionals with tools to manage the entire process from initial design through final inspection approval, including AHJ interaction, inspection scheduling, compliance tracking, and issue resolution workflows.

The system will integrate seamlessly with existing load calculations, wire sizing, and SLD features to provide a unified platform for electrical project management that meets the needs of contractors, engineers, and inspection authorities.
