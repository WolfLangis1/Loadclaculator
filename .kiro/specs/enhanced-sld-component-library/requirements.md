# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced SLD Component Library feature will transform the current basic component library into a comprehensive, user-friendly system that supports professional electrical design workflows. This enhancement will provide electrical professionals with an intuitive, searchable, and customizable component library that integrates seamlessly with Supabase for cloud storage and sharing capabilities.

The current SLD component library has basic functionality but lacks modern UX patterns, advanced search capabilities, custom component creation, cloud synchronization, and collaborative features that electrical professionals need for efficient diagram creation.

2. WHEN a custom component is created THEN the system SHALL validate electrical specifications and terminal configurations for safety compliance
3. WHEN a user saves a custom component THEN the system SHALL store it in their personal library with proper categorization and tagging
4. WHEN a custom component is used THEN the system SHALL track usage statistics and suggest improvements
5. WHEN a user exports custom components THEN the system SHALL support standard formats for sharing with team members

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to share component libraries with my team, so that we can maintain consistency across projects and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a team library THEN the system SHALL allow sharing of custom components with specific team members or groups
2. WHEN team components are shared THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls with read/write permissions
3. WHEN a shared component is modified THEN the system SHALL notify relevant team members and maintain version history
4. WHEN team members access shared libraries THEN the system SHALL sync changes in real-time across all users
5. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide merge resolution tools for component updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want cloud synchronization of my component library, so that I can access my custom components from any device and never lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or modifies components THEN the system SHALL automatically sync changes to Supabase cloud storage
2. WHEN a user switches devices THEN the system SHALL restore their complete component library including custom components and preferences
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue working offline and sync changes when connection is restored
4. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options with visual diff comparison
5. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL implement proper backup and recovery mechanisms with data integrity checks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an electrical designer, I want intelligent component recommendations, so that I can discover relevant components and improve my design efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a component THEN the system SHALL suggest compatible components for typical electrical connections
2. WHEN a user works on a project THEN the system SHALL recommend components based on project type, voltage levels, and load requirements
3. WHEN a user has usage patterns THEN the system SHALL learn preferences and prioritize frequently used components
4. WHEN NEC compliance is required THEN the system SHALL highlight compliant components and warn about non-compliant selections
5. WHEN new components are added to the library THEN the system SHALL notify users about relevant additions based on their interests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want drag-and-drop functionality with smart placement, so that I can efficiently add components to my SLD diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a component from the library THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing valid drop zones on the canvas
2. WHEN a component is dropped on the canvas THEN the system SHALL automatically position it with proper spacing and alignment
3. WHEN components are placed near each other THEN the system SHALL suggest automatic connections based on electrical compatibility
