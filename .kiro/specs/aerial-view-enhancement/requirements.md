# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing aerial view and site analysis feature to provide a comprehensive, workflow-driven toolset for electrical professionals. The enhanced feature will integrate satellite imagery, street view capture, solar analysis, and AI-powered roof analysis into a cohesive workflow that seamlessly integrates with the project management system. The goal is to transform the current basic aerial view functionality into a professional-grade site analysis tool that supports permit applications and project planning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want a guided workflow for site analysis so that I can systematically capture and analyze all necessary site information for my electrical projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the aerial view tab THEN the system SHALL present a clear workflow with sequential steps: Address Setup → Image Capture → Analysis → Documentation → Project Integration
2. WHEN I complete each workflow step THEN the system SHALL automatically advance to the next step and show progress indicators
3. WHEN I need to revisit previous steps THEN the system SHALL allow navigation between completed steps without losing data
4. IF I have incomplete required data in any step THEN the system SHALL prevent advancement and show clear validation messages
5. WHEN I complete the entire workflow THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all captured data and analysis results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want comprehensive image capture capabilities so that I can document the complete site context for my electrical installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a valid address THEN the system SHALL automatically capture high-resolution satellite imagery at multiple zoom levels (15, 17, 19, 21)
2. WHEN satellite imagery is captured THEN the system SHALL automatically capture street view images from all four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West)
3. WHEN images are captured THEN the system SHALL display them in an organized gallery with clear labeling and metadata
4. WHEN I want to recapture images THEN the system SHALL provide refresh controls for individual images or bulk refresh
5. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and provide retry options
6. WHEN I capture images THEN the system SHALL automatically save them to the current project's attachment collection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want integrated solar and roof analysis so that I can assess solar potential and roof characteristics for electrical planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have captured satellite imagery THEN the system SHALL provide one-click solar analysis using Google Solar API
2. WHEN solar analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display solar potential data including annual sunlight hours, solar panel capacity, and energy production estimates
3. WHEN I request AI roof analysis THEN the system SHALL analyze the satellite image using TensorFlow to identify roof features, obstacles, and suitable areas
4. WHEN AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL overlay detected features on the satellite image with color-coded annotations
5. WHEN analysis results are available THEN the system SHALL allow me to save analysis reports as project attachments
6. IF analysis APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate fallback messages and allow manual annotation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want measurement and annotation tools so that I can document distances, areas, and electrical components on aerial images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view satellite imagery THEN the system SHALL provide measurement tools for linear distances and area calculations
2. WHEN I use measurement tools THEN the system SHALL display real-world measurements in feet and meters with accuracy indicators
3. WHEN I want to annotate images THEN the system SHALL provide annotation tools for marking electrical components (panels, meters, conduits, obstacles)
4. WHEN I create annotations THEN the system SHALL allow custom labels, colors, and notes for each annotation
5. WHEN I complete measurements and annotations THEN the system SHALL save all markup data with the project
6. WHEN I export project data THEN the system SHALL include annotated images in the export package

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want seamless project integration so that all site analysis data becomes part of my project documentation for permits and planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete site analysis THEN the system SHALL automatically add all captured images to the project attachment system
2. WHEN images are added to attachments THEN the system SHALL categorize them appropriately (satellite_image, street_view, solar_analysis, roof_analysis)
3. WHEN I mark attachments for export THEN the system SHALL include them in PDF reports with proper formatting and metadata
4. WHEN I generate project reports THEN the system SHALL include a dedicated "Site Analysis" section with all aerial view data
5. WHEN I save the project THEN the system SHALL persist all analysis data, measurements, and annotations
6. WHEN I reopen a project THEN the system SHALL restore the complete site analysis state including all captured data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want reliable API integration so that all external services work consistently and provide fallback options when services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the secure backend proxy for all Google Maps, Solar, and Street View APIs
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest alternative actions
3. WHEN APIs are temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL cache previous results and allow offline viewing
4. WHEN I use the system THEN it SHALL validate API key configuration and show setup instructions if needed
5. WHEN making multiple API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and request queuing
6. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before displaying results

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want a responsive and intuitive interface so that I can efficiently use the aerial view tools on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the aerial view on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL adapt to smaller screens with touch-friendly controls
2. WHEN I interact with images THEN the system SHALL provide smooth zoom, pan, and annotation capabilities
3. WHEN I switch between workflow steps THEN the interface SHALL maintain context and show clear navigation
4. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and loading indicators
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable solutions
6. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN all controls SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts and tab navigation
