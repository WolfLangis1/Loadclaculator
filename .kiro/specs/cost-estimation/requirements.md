# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cost Estimation feature will provide electrical professionals with accurate material and labor cost calculations for their electrical projects. This feature will integrate with existing load calculations and wire sizing to automatically generate comprehensive project cost estimates, helping contractors provide competitive and accurate bids while ensuring profitability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an electrical contractor, I want to generate material cost estimates based on my load calculations, so that I can provide accurate project quotes to clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a Single line diagram or equipment list THEN the system SHALL automatically identify required materials and quantities
2. WHEN material quantities are calculated THEN the system SHALL apply current pricing from integrated databases
3. IF custom materials are needed THEN the system SHALL allow manual material entry with custom pricing
4. WHEN generating estimates THEN the system SHALL include wire, conduit, panels, breakers, and electrical components
5. WHEN displaying costs THEN the system SHALL show itemized breakdowns with quantities and unit prices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want to calculate labor costs based on project complexity and local rates, so that I can ensure profitable project pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN estimating labor THEN the system SHALL calculate hours based on project scope and complexity
2. WHEN labor rates are needed THEN the system SHALL support regional rate customization
3. IF specialized work is required THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate skill level multipliers
4. WHEN calculating labor THEN the system SHALL include installation, testing, and cleanup time
5. WHEN displaying labor costs THEN the system SHALL show hours breakdown by work category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a contractor, I want to apply markup percentages and overhead costs, so that I can maintain business profitability on projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating estimates THEN the system SHALL allow configurable markup percentages for materials
2. WHEN calculating totals THEN the system SHALL apply overhead costs as percentage or fixed amount
3. IF profit margins are specified THEN the system SHALL calculate final pricing with profit included
4. WHEN markup is applied THEN the system SHALL show cost breakdown including base cost, markup, and total
5. WHEN saving estimates THEN the system SHALL preserve markup settings for future use

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want to generate professional cost estimate reports, so that I can present detailed quotes to clients and use them for project planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN estimate is complete THEN the system SHALL generate formatted PDF reports
2. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL include company branding and contact information
3. IF detailed breakdown is needed THEN the system SHALL show line-item costs with descriptions
4. WHEN presenting to clients THEN the system SHALL offer summary view without detailed markup information
5. WHEN saving reports THEN the system SHALL maintain estimate history and version control

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a contractor, I want to compare multiple estimate scenarios, so that I can optimize project costs and present options to clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating estimates THEN the system SHALL support multiple scenario creation
2. WHEN comparing scenarios THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side cost comparisons
3. IF alternative materials are considered THEN the system SHALL calculate cost differences
4. WHEN scenarios differ THEN the system SHALL highlight cost variance and savings opportunities
5. WHEN finalizing estimates THEN the system SHALL allow scenario selection and conversion to final quote

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an electrical professional, I want to track actual costs against estimates, so that I can improve future estimate accuracy and project profitability analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects are completed THEN the system SHALL allow actual cost entry
2. WHEN comparing actual vs estimated THEN the system SHALL calculate variance percentages
3. IF significant variances exist THEN the system SHALL highlight areas for estimate improvement
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide historical accuracy reporting
5. WHEN updating pricing THEN the system SHALL suggest adjustments based on historical data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a contractor, I want to integrate with supplier pricing databases, so that I can maintain current material costs without manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pricing updates are available THEN the system SHALL support automated price synchronization
2. WHEN multiple suppliers exist THEN the system SHALL compare pricing and suggest best options
3. IF supplier integration fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to manual pricing with notifications
4. WHEN new materials are added THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic price lookup
5. WHEN pricing is outdated THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest updates
