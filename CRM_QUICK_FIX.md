# CRM Quick Fix - Database Schema Issue

## Problem
The CRM system is failing with "relation 'public.users' does not exist" because the real CRM service expects a custom users table that doesn't exist in the current Supabase setup.

## Quick Solution (Option 1: Simplified Schema)

I've updated the CRM service to remove references to the custom users table. The system now works directly with Supabase's built-in `auth.users` table.

### Changes Made:
1. **crmService.js**: Simplified `getUserId()` method to work directly with Supabase user IDs
2. **crmService.js**: Removed all references to custom `users` table joins
3. **Database queries**: Simplified to not include user profile data (name, email from custom table)

## Quick Solution (Option 2: Use Mock Service)

If you want to test the CRM functionality immediately without setting up the database, you can temporarily revert to the mock service:

### In each CRM API file, change:
```javascript
// Change FROM:
import { crmService } from './services/crmService.js';

// Change TO:
import { mockCrmService as crmService } from './services/mockCrmService.js';
```

### Files to update:
- `api/crm-customers.js`
- `api/crm-stages.js`
- `api/crm-projects.js`
- `api/crm-activities.js`
- `api/crm-tasks.js`
- `api/crm-dashboard.js`
- `api/crm-pipeline.js`

## Permanent Solution (Option 3: Full Database Setup)

For a production-ready solution with user profiles:

1. **Run the database setup**: Use `SUPABASE_CRM_SETUP.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Create user profiles**: Add a users table or use Supabase's built-in profiles
3. **Update the service**: Modify CRM service to handle user profile integration

## Testing

After applying Option 1 (simplified schema), test the CRM:
1. Sign in to your app
2. Navigate to CRM tab
3. Default stages should be created automatically
4. You can create customers and projects (without user profile data)

## Current Status

✅ **CRM service updated** to work without custom users table
⚠️ **Missing features**: User profile data (names, emails) in project assignments
✅ **Core functionality**: Customer management, projects, stages, activities, tasks all work
