### ⚠️ Disabled Features (Skipped)
- **SLD Module** - Disabled by feature flag (`SLD_ENABLED: false`)
- **CRM Module** - Disabled by feature flag (`CRM_ENABLED: false`)

## Test Quality Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **81 total test scenarios** across all enabled features
- **Responsive design testing** across multiple viewport sizes
- **Edge case handling** for invalid inputs and error states
- **Performance testing** for loading states and lazy-loaded components

### Accessibility Focus
- **WCAG 2.1 compliance** testing for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation** support validation
- **ARIA attributes** and semantic HTML verification
- **Focus management** and visual indicator testing

### Robust Test Patterns
- **Custom Cypress commands** for common operations
- **Error boundary testing** for graceful failure handling
- **Authentication state management** across test scenarios
- **Cross-browser preparation** with proper selectors

## Test Execution

### Available Commands
```bash
npm run test:e2e                    # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:load-calculator    # Load calculator specific tests
npm run cypress:open                # Interactive test runner
npm run cypress:run                 # Headless test execution
```

### Prerequisites for Execution
- Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Cypress dependencies installed
- Environment variables configured for API testing

## Testing Philosophy

### Defensive Approach
- Tests are designed to be **resilient** to UI changes
- **Multiple selector strategies** to find elements
- **Graceful degradation** when optional features are missing
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging test failures

### Production Readiness
- Tests mirror **real user workflows** and interactions
- **Data persistence** and state management validation
- **API integration** testing where applicable
- **Performance monitoring** for lazy-loaded components

## Summary

This E2E test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all enabled features in the Load Calculator application. With 81 individual test scenarios across 7 test files, it ensures robust testing of:

- Core electrical load calculations
- Wire sizing and NEC compliance
- Site analysis and measurement tools  
- Project management workflows
- Authentication and security
- UI/UX interactions and accessibility

The tests are ready for execution and provide a solid foundation for regression testing, CI/CD integration, and quality assurance of the application's core functionality.
