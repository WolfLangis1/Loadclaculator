# CRM Integration Implementation

This document outlines the completed CRM integration features that automatically save project data, PDFs, and images to the CRM system.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Enhanced Project Information Form
- **Added Fields**: Email and phone number fields added to the project information form
- **Location**: `src/components/LoadCalculator/ProjectInformation.tsx`
- **Validation**: Both email format and phone number validation included

### ✅ 2. Smart "Save to CRM" Button
- **Intelligent Activation**: Button lights up when all required fields are completed
- **Real-time Validation**: Shows validation errors for incomplete fields
- **Visual States**: 
  - Disabled (gray) when fields incomplete
  - Active (white with green text) when ready
  - Loading state with spinner
  - Success state (green) with checkmark
  - Error state (red) with error message

**Required Fields for CRM Save:**
- Customer Name
- Property Address
- Calculated By
- Square Footage > 0
- Either Email OR Phone Number

### ✅ 3. Automatic PDF Export to CRM
- **Location**: `src/services/pdfExportService.ts`
- **Behavior**: When PDF export is clicked, the PDF is automatically saved to CRM customer attachments
- **Filename**: `Electrical_Load_Calculation_[CustomerName]_[Date].pdf`
- **CRM Description**: "Load calculation report"

### ✅ 4. Automatic Aerial View Images to CRM
- **Satellite Images**: `src/components/AerialView/SimpleAerialViewMain.tsx`
- **Annotated Images**: Auto-saved when annotations are saved
- **Street View Images**: `src/components/AerialView/StreetViewGallery.tsx`
- **All images**: Automatically saved to CRM customer attachments when downloaded

### ✅ 5. Professional CRM Integration Service
- **Location**: `src/services/crmProjectIntegrationService.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Customer creation with project details
  - Project creation linked to customer
  - File attachment handling
  - Error handling and fallbacks
  - Validation and formatting utilities

## How It Works

### Workflow
1. **Fill Project Information**: User completes customer name, address, contact info, calculated by, and square footage
2. **Save to CRM Button Activates**: Button changes from gray to white with green text
3. **Click Save to CRM**: Creates customer and project in CRM system
4. **Export PDF**: Automatically saves to CRM customer attachments
5. **Download Images**: Satellite, street view, and annotated images auto-save to CRM

### Data Flow
```
Project Form → CRM Integration Service → CRM API
     ↓
PDF Export → Auto-save to CRM Attachments
     ↓
Image Downloads → Auto-save to CRM Attachments
```

### CRM Data Structure
**Customer Record:**
- Name, email, phone
- Full address (street, city, state, zip)
- Project metadata (square footage, calculation date, etc.)
- Tags: ['Load Calculator']
- Source: 'Load Calculator Application'

**Project Record:**
- Linked to customer
- Project name and description
- Custom fields with electrical calculation data
- Status: 'quoted' (can be updated later)

**Attachments:**
- PDF load calculation reports
- Satellite view images
- Street view images (multiple angles)
- Annotated images with measurements

## Technical Implementation

### Feature Flag Control
CRM integration is controlled by the feature flag system:
```typescript
// src/config/featureFlags.ts
crm: {
  enabled: false  // Set to true to enable CRM
}
```

### Safe Context Usage
```typescript
// Uses safe CRM hook that doesn't throw errors
const crm = useCRMSafe();
if (crm) {
  // CRM is available
}
```

### Error Handling
All CRM operations include error handling:
- PDF export continues even if CRM save fails
- Image downloads continue even if CRM save fails
- User sees local save completion regardless of CRM status
- Console logs provide debugging information

### API Endpoints
CRM integration expects these API endpoints:
- `POST /api/crm-customers` - Create customer
- `POST /api/crm-projects` - Create project
- `POST /api/crm-attachments` - Upload attachments

## Testing

### Enable CRM for Testing
1. Set feature flag: `crm.enabled = true` in `src/config/featureFlags.ts`
2. Ensure CRM context is available
3. Fill out complete project information
4. Test the "Save to CRM" button
5. Export PDF and download images to test automatic attachment

### Validation Testing
Test incomplete forms to verify validation:
- Missing customer name
- Missing address
- Missing calculated by
- Missing square footage
- Missing both email and phone

## File Changes Made

### Core Files
- `src/types/calculation.ts` - Added email field to ProjectInformation
- `src/constants/initialProjectInfo.ts` - Added email and missing fields
- `src/components/LoadCalculator/ProjectInformation.tsx` - Added CRM UI and logic
- `src/services/crmProjectIntegrationService.ts` - New CRM integration service
- `src/services/pdfExportService.ts` - Added auto-save to CRM
- `src/components/AerialView/SimpleAerialViewMain.tsx` - Added CRM auto-save for images
- `src/components/AerialView/StreetViewGallery.tsx` - Added CRM auto-save for street views

### Configuration Files
- `src/config/featureFlags.ts` - Added CRM feature flag
- `src/context/UnifiedAppContext.tsx` - Added conditional CRM provider

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. CRM API endpoints must be implemented and deployed
2. Feature flag must be enabled: `crm.enabled = true`
3. CRM database tables must be created (customers, projects, attachments)
4. Authentication and authorization for CRM API endpoints

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed - CRM integration uses existing API infrastructure.

### Monitoring
Console logs provide visibility into CRM operations:
- `✅ PDF automatically saved to CRM customer attachments`
- `✅ Satellite image automatically saved to CRM customer attachments`
- `✅ Street view [direction] automatically saved to CRM customer attachments`

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Seamless Integration**: No extra steps required - everything saves automatically
- **Complete Records**: All project data, calculations, and images stored together
- **Professional Workflow**: From calculation to CRM in one smooth process

### For Business
- **Automatic Lead Capture**: Every calculation becomes a CRM customer
- **Complete Documentation**: PDFs and site images attached automatically
- **Sales Pipeline**: Projects automatically enter CRM pipeline
- **Follow-up Ready**: All contact information captured for sales follow-up

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- Project value estimation based on calculation complexity
- Automatic email sending with PDF attachments
- Integration with proposal generation systems
- Customer portal access to calculations and images
- Mobile app integration for field updates

### Advanced CRM Features
- Lead scoring based on project size and complexity
- Automated follow-up sequences
- Integration with calendar for site visits
- Photo management and organization
- Measurement data export to design software

This implementation provides a complete bridge between the electrical load calculator and CRM system, ensuring no leads are lost and all project documentation is properly stored and organized.
