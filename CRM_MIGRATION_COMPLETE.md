# CRM Migration to Real Supabase Service - COMPLETED âœ…

## Migration Summary

All CRM API endpoints have been successfully updated to use the real Supabase CRM service instead of the mock service. Your application is now ready to use a production database.

## Changes Made

### API Endpoints Updated

All 7 CRM API endpoint files have been migrated:

1. âœ… **crm-customers.js** - Customer management
2. âœ… **crm-stages.js** - Pipeline stage management  
3. âœ… **crm-projects.js** - Project tracking
4. âœ… **crm-activities.js** - Activity logging
5. âœ… **crm-tasks.js** - Task management
6. âœ… **crm-dashboard.js** - Dashboard metrics
7. âœ… **crm-pipeline.js** - Pipeline visualization

### Specific Changes Per File

Each file was updated with:
- **Import Statement**: Changed from `mockCrmService` to `crmService`
- **Parameter Names**: Updated from `userId` to `firebaseUid` for consistency with the real service
- **Service Reference**: Now points to the production-ready Supabase database service

### Before vs After

**Before (Mock Service):**
```javascript
import { mockCrmService as crmService } from './services/mockCrmService.js';
const userId = authHeader.replace('Bearer ', '');
const customers = await crmService.getCustomers(userId, req.query);
```

**After (Real Service):**
```javascript
import { crmService } from './services/crmService.js';
const firebaseUid = authHeader.replace('Bearer ', '');
const customers = await crmService.getCustomers(firebaseUid, req.query);
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Supabase Database

Before using the CRM system, you need to run the database setup:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**: https://app.supabase.com
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Run the setup script**: Copy and paste the contents of `SUPABASE_CRM_SETUP.sql`
4. **Verify tables created**: Check that all CRM tables appear in Table Editor

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure you have these environment variables configured:

```bash
# Required
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional (for enhanced functionality)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Test the CRM System

1. **Start your application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Sign in with Google** authentication
3. **Navigate to CRM tab**
4. **Test functionality**:
   - Dashboard loads without errors
   - Default stages are created automatically
   - You can create customers
   - You can create projects
   - Activities and tasks work correctly

## What You Get Now

- **Activity Logging**: Complete interaction history
- **Task Management**: Action items with due dates
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time metrics and reporting

## Important Notes

### Database Schema

The system creates these tables:
- `crm_customers` - Customer contact information
- `crm_stages` - Pipeline stages configuration
- `crm_projects` - Individual electrical projects
- `crm_activities` - Timeline of interactions
- `crm_tasks` - Action items and to-dos

### Default Data

When a user first accesses the CRM, default pipeline stages are automatically created:
1. **Lead** (Red) - Initial contact and qualification
2. **Site Visit** (Orange) - Scheduled site assessment
3. **Proposal** (Yellow) - Quote prepared and sent
4. **Contracted** (Green) - Project approved and contracted
5. **Completed** (Blue) - Project finished and invoiced

### Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid Supabase user token
- **Row Level Security**: Database policies ensure data isolation
- **Permission Checks**: Users can only access their own data
- **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked with timestamps

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Table doesn't exist" errors**:
   - Run the `SUPABASE_CRM_SETUP.sql` script in your Supabase dashboard
   - Verify you're connected to the correct project

2. **"User not authenticated" errors**:
   - Ensure you're signed in with Google OAuth
   - Check that `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correctly set

3. **"Permission denied" errors**:
   - Verify Row Level Security policies were created correctly
   - Check that the authenticated user exists in `auth.users`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Supabase logs in **Dashboard â†’ Logs â†’ Database**
2. Verify environment variables in your hosting platform
3. Test API endpoints directly using the browser's Network tab
4. Review the `SUPABASE_CRM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file for detailed setup steps
